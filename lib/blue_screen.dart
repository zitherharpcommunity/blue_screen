/// **Blue Screen of Death (BSoD)**
///
/// The **Blue Screen of Death (BSoD)**, **Blue screen error**, **Blue Screen**,
/// **fatal error**, or **bugcheck**, and officially known as a **Stop error**,
/// is a critical error screen displayed
/// by the _Microsoft Windows_ and _ReactOS_ operating systems
/// in the event of a fatal system error.
///
/// The **Blue Screen of Death** indicates a system crash,
/// in which the operating system has reached a critical condition
/// where it can no longer operate safely.
///
/// Possible issues include hardware failure,
/// an issue with or without a device driver,
/// or unexpected termination of a crucial process or thread.
///
/// And this library allows you to create a custom [BlueScreenWidget] in your own project.
